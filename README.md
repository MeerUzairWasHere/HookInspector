# HookInspector

**Inspect HTTP requests in real-time, debug webhooks, and analyze HTTP traffic effortlessly with a free alternative.**

Made out of necessity, because I needed a webhook service, but it was paid ‚Äî so I made it free for you! ‚ù§Ô∏è

This is a simple webhook service that allows you to send and view HTTP requests. It's completely free, and the best part is that your webhooks will be cleared after 24 hours, making it a temporary but useful solution.

## Features

- **Free Unlimited Usage**: No cost for using the service!
- **Free Database**: Webhooks are stored temporarily for 24 hours. After that, they are automatically cleared.
- **Deployed on Free Instances**: The app is hosted on free instances, so you can rely on it without any charges.
- **Real-time HTTP Inspection**: View HTTP requests as they come in and debug webhooks easily.
